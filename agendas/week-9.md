## Shallow ice approximation 

Starting with the stress balance equations

$$
\frac{\partial \sigma_{xx}}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial \tau_{yx}}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial \tau_{zx}}{\partial z} = 0\\
$$


$$
\frac{\partial \tau_{xy}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{yy}}{\partial y} +\frac{\partial \tau_{zy}}{\partial z} = 0
$$


$$
\frac{\partial \tau_{xz}}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial \tau_{yz}}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial \sigma_{zz}}{\partial z} = \rho g
$$




we will derive an equation for the ice flux $q$ in one horizontal dimension:  

$$
q = \int^H_0 u(z) dz
$$
