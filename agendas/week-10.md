# Agenda, week 10. 

We have a SIA equation. What shall we do with it?

## SIA as a diffusion equation

We will discuss how the SIA model we derived can be thought of as a nonlinear diffusion equation.


## Numerical solution to the equations. 

We will look through some code that solves the SIA model using a simple finite-difference scheme. 



## Vertical velocity

We will look at what the SIA says about vertical velocities.

## Dating of crevasse burial (Wearing and Kingslake, 2020)

We will briefly look through a simple analysis that Martin Wearing and Jonny worked on in a paper about the Henry Ice Rise and the englacial features found there.
